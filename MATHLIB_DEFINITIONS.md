# Mathlib definitions used in Challenge.lean (the Lovász Local Lemma)

Verbatim excerpts of the Mathlib definitions used by the statements in `Challenge.lean`, at the
pinned Mathlib revision `c55e6e786f49471c72fbddbec5415808896aec1e` (tag `v4.35.0-rc3`, repository
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). Mathlib is released under the Apache-2.0
